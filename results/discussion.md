## Discussion of the results
### What are the results?
Using some python scripts and other methods I managed to compile the information about __De-Novo proteins in CATH__ into [one big csv](https://github.com/CATH-summer-2017/De-Novo/blob/master/results/final_results.csv). My research shows the 463 De-Novo proteins in CATH are spread across 65 different superfamilies. However only 20 superfamilies have De-Novo that contribute to more than 5% of all domains. They are listed in the __table below:__

### Discussion

As we can see from the table above, among the 20 superfamilies with over 5% De-Novo content, 6 have an over 50% De-Novo content, while having only 27 domains. It seems to me that these superfamilies might not belong in CATH, escpecially since some of them are very small ([1.20.120.660](http://cathdb.info/version/v4_1_0/superfamily/1.20.120.660/) is a good example, having only 1 domain). However I am still unsure about the general idea of De-Novo proteins in CATH
